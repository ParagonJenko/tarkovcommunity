# Tarkov Community

A website inspired by the work of ThatFriendlyGuy on the @tarkovcommunity X/Twitter handle.

Idea is to bring in as much Tarkov content into one place.

## V2:

This build focuses more on expanding my skills into Vite/webpack and more advanced techniques. Honestly it wouldn't have been as successful without the help of ChatGPT to direct me to the right resources!

## V3:

I decided to go all out here! I've implemented:

- A better JavaScript environment, focuses on splitting logic across functions more logically.
- Implementing seasonal changes to make it easier to switch out!
- Created a terminal style alert and made it into a [CodePen](https://codepen.io/ParagonJenko/pen/abXNgXm) to be easier to share and re-use.
- Overlaid the 8k (but compressed and resized) image, turned this into a responsive image map that dynamically updates an offCanvas

## What's next?

I don't really know for sure, I'd like to make the events something the community/trusted people can update. I think that'd need a backend though with a NoSQL database maybe? Koa and MongoDB are my current ideas with Discord as the auth!
