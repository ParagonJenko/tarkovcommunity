## Epics:

- Improve dropdown UX.
- Add handlers for events, to be easier to manipulate than editing DOM.

- Add analytics

## Challenges

- Twitter API for Free only allows write-only use cases, therefore wouldn't be useful for the purpose I'd like to use this for.
- This is primarily front-end work, and storing secrets such as the API keys are a challenge.

## Extra Epics

- When the YouTube thumbnails are clicked, update the iframe and play that.
- Gracefully check for the API returning data, before returning placeholder data and a notice.
- Add an alert button on the top for events using [Bootstrap Alerts](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/alerts/) :white_check_mark:
- For map-specific events, have a pop-over on the specific maps. :white_check_mark: - partially completed, I'd like to revisit how we display this.
