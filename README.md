# Tarkov Community

A website inspired by the work of ThatFriendlyGuy on the @tarkovcommunity X/Twitter handle.

Idea is to bring in as much Tarkov content into one place.

Current usage:

- Displaying the last 4 videos by BattleState Games.
- Display links to great tools.
- Utilising the API to display the maps.

## V2:

This build focuses more on expanding my skills into Vite/webpack and more advanced techniques. Honestly it wouldn't have been as successful without the help of ChatGPT to direct me to the right resources!
