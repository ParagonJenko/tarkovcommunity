# Tarkov Community

A website inspired by the work of ThatFriendlyGuy on the @tarkovcommunity X/Twitter handle.

Idea is to bring in as much Tarkov content into one place.

Current usage:

- Displaying the last 4 videos by BattleState Games.
- Display links to great tools.
- Utilising the API to display the maps.

## V2:

This build focuses more on expanding my skills into Vite/webpack and more advanced techniques. Honestly it wouldn't have been as successful without the help of ChatGPT to direct me to the right resources!

## What's next?

Styling! I am an awful UI/UXer so I'll probably end up tidying this up more.

A big one is there's a 8k image of the full Tarkov map where I could use some animations to display the maps vs my homemade nav bar. Idea for the future, for now V2 is done and dusted.
